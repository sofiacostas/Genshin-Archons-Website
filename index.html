            <p>The Seven Archons, typically shortened to The Seven, are the seven gods who preside over the seven regions of Teyvat, established after they or their predecessors 
            emerged as the victors of the Archon War 2,000 years ago. Each Archon is associated with an element and an ideal, by which they formed their territories' environment 
            and determined their method of governance over their regions.Each Archon possesses a magic focus called a Gnosis, which allows them to resonate directly with Celestia.
            By comparison, Visions are "primitive" â€” though a Gnosis's capabilities and purpose, beyond acting as a symbol of an Archon's status, remain unknown. Each Archon is bound 
            to a Divine Throne, which is composed of the Elemental Authority of one of the Seven Sovereigns, and which grants them authority over the corresponding element.</p>

        <h3>Archon War</h3>
        <p>The Archon War began an indeterminate time in the past, and ended around 2,000 years ago. During this period of time, many gods and archons roamed the land, 
            locked in a bitter struggle for supremacy. It appears that the battles associated with the Archon War are a multitude of local struggles that were grouped 
            together by human history. For example, Barbatos became the first Anemo Archon among The Seven after the death of Decarabian 2,600 years ago, while Morax 
            is implied to have already become Geo Archon by the time the last of the original Seven claimed their title and thus brought an end to the War.
            The original Seven appeared to be relatively close, sharing a common duty of guiding humanity and often gathering in Liyue for drinks. However, over time, 
            five of The Seven passed away, and some of the newer Archons no longer adhered to the duty of guiding humanity.</p>
