        The Seven Archons, typically shortened to The Seven, are the seven gods who preside over the seven regions of Teyvat, established after they or their predecessors 
        emerged as the victors of the Archon War 2,000 years ago. Each Archon is associated with an element and an ideal, by which they formed their territories' environment 
        and determined their method of governance over their regions.Each Archon possesses a magic focus called a Gnosis, which allows them to resonate directly with Celestia.
        By comparison, Visions are "primitive" â€” though a Gnosis's capabilities and purpose, beyond acting as a symbol of an Archon's status, remain unknown. Each Archon is bound 
        to a Divine Throne, which is composed of the Elemental Authority of one of the Seven Sovereigns, and which grants them authority over the corresponding element.
